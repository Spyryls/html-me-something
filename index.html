                    <p>"Mono-No Aware."
                    </p>

                    <p>"Mo-no No A-wa-re" is an archaic Japanese concept according to our Okinawan exchange student,
                        though it pretty much sums up the reality of my time in Japan. The concept does not really have
                        an easy meaning outside of its parent culture. To attempt a translation, perhaps having a
                        sensitivity for the ephemeral, which almost begs for its own definition.
                    </p>

                    <p>In essence, it is an concept of visual appreciation. It accepts that the beauty that exists in
                        the world should be enjoyed and celebrated as someday that beauty will diminish and fall away.
                        It is a understanding about the impermanance of life and situations.
                    </p>

                    <p>And though I understand that Japan has not actually gone anywhere, Honsho is still an island,
                        Biwa Lake has not evaporated, Abe is still PM (he's still Prime Minister!), and Arashiyama
                        continues to draw tourists, my time and my experiences there are over and cannot return. I can
                        cherish them as memories, but I can no longer interact with them. And this fills me with both
                        longing and joy at once. This is Mono-No Aware and it is where this story begins.

                        "Kuwai vs. Kawai"
                    </p>

                    <p>When I first arrived, I had no idea what to expect. I had study Japanese history and art,
                        philosophy and language, but the book learning could not prepare me for the little
                        excentricities that actually being in Japan had waiting for me. All I knew was that I had made
                        it into the JET Programe, I was being sent to a place that I had always iconized, and that I
                        was, all of the sudden, going to be an abnormally large individual.</p>

                    <p>I remember getting off the plane and immediately felt the difference. You see, I had never been
                        out of the country prior to this. Off the bat, I was on my heels because, even though I had
                        taken a year of Japanese at university in an attempt to prepare myself for the new language, I
                        could not understand a single thing being said on the intercoms. It was as though my language
                        know-how pulled a one-eighty on me and hopped back on the plane for the return flight.</p>

                    <p>If it were not for the JET Programe supervisors and my team leader being present, I think I would
                        have made many more mistakes than just tripping over language and telling my Board of Education
                        attache&#769 that the picture of his child was scary. You see, in Japanese the words "kuwai" and
                        "kawai" seem similar, but are wildly different in meaning. Even though I knew and thought I was
                        telling this man that his child was "kawai," or "cute," my inexperience with the proper
                        intonation made it sound like I was saying, <b>"hey, your daughter is a monsterous brute! Thanks
                            for having me in Japan!"</b>
