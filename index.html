                    <p>"Mono-No Aware."
                    </p>

                    <p>"Mo-no No A-wa-re" is an archaic Japanese concept according to our Okinawan exchange student,
                        though it pretty much sums up the reality of my time in Japan. The concept does not really have
                        an easy meaning outside of its parent culture. To attempt a translation, perhaps having a
                        sensitivity for the ephemeral, which almost begs for its own definition.
                    </p>

                    <p>In essence, it is an concept of visual appreciation. It accepts that the beauty that exists in
                        the world should be enjoyed and celebrated as someday that beauty will diminish and fall away.
                        It is a understanding about the impermanance of life and situations.
                    </p>

                    <p>And though I understand that Japan has not actually gone anywhere, Honsho is still an island,
                        Biwa Lake has not evaporated, Abe is still PM (he's still Prime Minister!), and Arashiyama
                        continues to draw tourists, my time and my experiences there are over and cannot return. I can
                        cherish them as memories, but I can no longer interact with them. And this fills me with both
                        longing and joy at once. This is Mono-No Aware and it is where this story begins.

                        "Kuwai vs. Kawai"
                    </p>

                    <p>When I first arrived, I had no idea what to expect. I had study Japanese history and art,
                        philosophy and language, but the book learning could not prepare me for the little
                        excentricities that actually being in Japan had waiting for me. All I knew was that I had made
                        it into the JET Programe, I was being sent to a place that I had always iconized, and that I
                        was, all of the sudden, going to be an abnormally large individual.</p>

                    <p>I remember getting off the plane and immediately felt the difference. You see, I had never been
                        out of the country prior to this. Off the bat, I was on my heels because, even though I had
                        taken a year of Japanese at university in an attempt to prepare myself for the new language, I
                        could not understand a single thing being said on the intercoms. It was as though my language
                        know-how pulled a one-eighty on me and hopped back on the plane for the return flight.</p>

                    <p>If it were not for the JET Programe supervisors and my team leader being present, I think I would
                        have made many more mistakes than just tripping over language and telling my Board of Education
                        attache&#769 that the picture of his child was scary. You see, in Japanese the words "kuwai" and
                        "kawai" seem similar, but are wildly different in meaning. Even though I knew and thought I was
                        telling this man that his child was "kawai," or "cute," my inexperience with the proper
                        intonation made it sound like I was saying, <b>"hey, your daughter is a monsterous brute! Thanks
                            for having me in Japan!"</b>

                <h2>Journey</h2>
                <div>

                    <p>"Culture Shock is Real!"
                    </p>

                    <p> The journey begins much like any journey: excitment for the experience; apprehension on what to
                        expect; wonder about who we will meet and what we will do; fantasies about meeting someone rich
                        and famous, hitting it off, perhaps on a movie set or in a coffeeshop, and becoming the next
                        BradJolina. All right, perhaps that last part is just me and my weird, caffeine-induced
                        ponderings, but it is not entirely unheard of (I know a person who almost bagged the
                        drummer for the Eagles in a Cambridge pub. True story.)
                    </p>

                    <p>What really happened is that I found myself in a rather tiny apartment courtesy of my local
                        school supervisor. This was my first lesson in culture shock: I missed my shabby flat in
                        Midwestern America. Being six-foot-five and living out of what was called a "shoebox apartment"
                        was a fairly serious shift in cultural living expectations. Thinking back now on my then-self, I
                        am not the proudest of my reaction. But after the crying and wailings about "what am I doing
                        here" subsided, I came to love my little place. I did buy a tiny bed, though. I'm not ashamed.
                        Tatami mats, even stacked on top of one another, are not sustainable.
                    </p>

                    <p>The culture shock did not end there, but it did get better. Walking around the streets of a new
                        place, I had not really thought about small things like the small of seaweed in the air, trees
                        looming around every horizon, and just how compact that horizon can seem when one is used to the
                        openness of the Kansas plains. Regardless, I came to love it. One of my favorite morning rituals
                        was to come out of that very ledge pictured above and just gaze. Sometimes, I would even draw or
                        paint from that vantage point. I even met some of my neighbors that way, in fact.
                    </p>

                    <p>Yeah, my supervisor, Yamamoto, called me up one Saturday morning and asked if he could come over.
                        I thought it odd, but said sure as he lived nearby. Yamamoto arrived and inquired into my
                        morning after I offered him some coffee. I responded it was lovely. The day had a smell of rain
                        and the fog was hanging on the mountains to the north; what could be better? He then asked me if
                        I could stop hanging out on my walkway. Befuddled, I asked why and he said that one of my
                        neighbors had called him concerned I was looking in their windows when I would sketch. I could
                        not help be laugh a little, not sure whether it was anxious or actual amusment, but there I was
                        a stranger in strange land and making a name for myself as a giant peeping creepy guy. The
                        neighbor came out while this was all happening, talked to Yamamoto, and we got it all cleared
                        away. As we all went on our merrys, Yamamoto turned back to me again and said with a smile,
                        "perhaps no more drawing on ledge," and walked home. And I was still left there with my coffee,
                        my rain smells, and my fog on the mountains. Who was I to argue with culture?</p>

                            "Relationships, With Art and Otherwise"
                        </p>

                        <p>Sitting here, trring to consider just how Japan has affected me and my outlook, I find it
                            difficult to ock down any one or two things that I can say, "yeah, that's it, that's all
                            different!" It is more of a comprehensive shift in behavior and practice.</p>

                        <p>It was one of those experiences that erupted in an entire paradigm shift. My idea of
                            friendship, for one, was entirely changed. I had friends before I hopped the Pacific, but
                            not like they people I met while I was in Kyoto. I figured out that it was all right to give
                            more of yourself and be vulnerable with others, trusting that they wouldn't take advantage
                            of that vulnerability. They might raze you, sure, but in a way that is uplifting and not
                            meant to actual insult or belittle. Then again, maybe that just highlighted the difference
                            in cultural expectation between Japan's more community-centric model and America's "I'm an
                            American! BOOTSTRAPS!(fireworks!)" modus operandi.</p>

                        <p>
                            My art changed quite a bit! I had always appreciated Japanese art, but after living in such
                            a historically rich area, I really invested myself in their style. I incorporated the hard
                            lines and seemingly floating images into my paintings, a style represented in their ukiyo-e
                            woodblock print. The brush stroke I use to make those lines is an interpretation of Shodo,
                            or Japanese zen calligraphy. You see much of that in modern anime design. It is a system of
                            expression that is both subtle and evocative.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Regardless, I am here and a better person than when left. It was one of those "saving point"
                            experierences that really imprints itself on one's psyche. Much like I still picture my
                            physical image as that of my seventeen year old self, all lanky and clumsy of limb with a
                            head of hair and ridiculous metabolism, I still look around in the mornings for my
                            mountains, with mist gently drifting across them and am sometimes surprised not smell the
                            sea in the air. But sadly, tree cover mountains and salty bodies of water are scant in St.
                            Louis. But hey, as mentioned above, nothing is permanant. Every thing and experience is
                            transient. And that's all right. Celebrate those changes and the beauty of the ever-shifting
                            scene of existence. It's all Natsukashi, people. Here's another monkey!
